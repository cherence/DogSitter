Question 1)

  a) There were quite a few libraries being used (firebase, facebook, AHBottonNavigation) = 3
  b) I can't see if you are directly using asynctasks becuase of the use of libraries though I am sure the libraries are using them.
  might be good to get practice using them directly = 1
  c) There is a fragment but it doens't look like its in use yet can't really comment on this = n/a
  d) Don't see a recycler view can't comment here = n/a
  e) Firebase is being used to manage login so I am sure it was the right choice over SQLite = 3
  
Question 2)
  
  UI/UX hasn't been built out yet but from what I can tell it seems to follow a good logical flow = n/a
  
Question 3)
  
  Code looks neat. small methods being utilized and flow is reasonable to follow even without lots of JavaDocs =3
  
Question 4)

  "setAuthenticatedUser" it was short and clear with good use of supporting methods that were also physically located close to the
  method itself.
  
  most of the code is clear I can definately tell its your code. The only place where it doesn't look so nice is in the onCreate. 
  methods could be created to clean that up but I have a feeling you were already planning on that.
  
Question 5)

  good use of identify sub-packages looks clear at that level. The Activities package has a ton of activities slightly overwhelming to
  look at. I would have figured the 'home' activity was the home screen or something. There were several activities outside of the
  activities package so that stood out as odd. Model are nice and clear. everything looks good so far.
